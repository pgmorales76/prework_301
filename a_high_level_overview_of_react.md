# A High Level Overview of React

## What is ***React***?

1. React is a **User Interface (UI) Library**. Meaning, it's used, primarily, for creating user interfaces on websites, apps, browsers, or anything the user is going to see/experience when using their desktop, laptop, mobile device, etc

2. React has a **Component Architecture**. Look [here](/dive_into_react.md) for a definition of "component"

3. React has a **One-Way Data Flow**

4. We have **Component State** in native React. This means we can manage state data or changes that are happening in out application, but they're controlled at a *component* level

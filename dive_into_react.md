# Dive Into React

## *What is React?*

### React is an **agnostic** (React doesn't care where your User Interface will, ultimately, display) User Interface (UI) library. For purposes of web development, React will be used in conjunction with ReactDOM, a companion library used to display the UI in the browser

### A React element isn't a DOM element UNTIL it's passed through ReactDOM, In React, an element is a JS object

### A UI is anything that facilitates the interaction between a user and a machine. In the world of computers, it can be anything from a keyboard, a joystick, a screen or a program. In case of computer software, it can be a command-line prompt, a webpage, a user input form, or the front-end of any application [UI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UI)
